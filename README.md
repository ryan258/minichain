# üîó Minimal Prompt Chainables

Welcome to the **Minimal Prompt Chainables** project! This project demonstrates how to implement Sequential Prompt Chaining in Python without relying on complex external libraries. Instead, we stay "close to the metal" by using simple and direct code that you can easily understand and customize.

## üåü Project Overview

### What is Sequential Prompt Chaining?

Sequential Prompt Chaining is a technique where the output of one prompt is used as the input for the next. This allows you to build complex workflows in a step-by-step manner, where each step depends on the results of the previous one.

### Why Use Minimal Prompt Chainables?

This project provides a minimalistic approach to prompt chaining. By keeping things simple, you gain full control over how prompts are processed and can easily understand what's happening at each step.

## üõ†Ô∏è Project Files

- **`chain.py`**: The core file containing the logic for Sequential Prompt Chaining and Fusion Chaining.
  - **`MinimalChainable`**: Handles simple sequential chaining with context and output references.
  - **`FusionChain`**: Allows multiple models to compete on a set of prompts, evaluating and ranking their outputs.
- **`simple_story_chain.py`**: An example that shows how to create a simple story using Sequential Prompt Chaining.
- **`math_challenge_chain.py`**: An example that runs a math challenge where each problem builds on the previous one.
- **`adventure_chain.py`**: An example that creates an adventure where choices lead to different outcomes.
- **`brand_creation_chain.py`**: A more complex example where characters work together to create a brand.
- **`requirements.txt`**: A list of the Python packages needed for this project.
- **`chain_test.py`**: Contains tests for the chaining logic to ensure everything works correctly.

## üíª Setting Up the Project on Windows 11 Using Miniconda

To run this project on your Windows 11 machine, you'll use Miniconda to manage the Python environment. Follow these steps:

### 1. Install Miniconda

If you haven't installed Miniconda yet, download it from the [official Miniconda website](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) and follow the installation instructions for Windows.

### 2. Create a New Conda Environment

Open the **Anaconda Prompt** and create a new environment specifically for this project.

```bash
conda create -n prompt_chainables python=3.11
```

Activate the new environment:

```bash
conda activate prompt_chainables
```

### 3. Install the Required Packages

Navigate to the directory where you have your project files (using `cd` in the command prompt) and install the necessary packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Running the Examples

With everything set up, you can now run the example scripts to see Sequential Prompt Chaining in action.

#### Simple Story Chain

This example generates a simple story using chained prompts:

```bash
python simple_story_chain.py
```

#### Math Challenge Chain

This example runs a math challenge where each step builds on the previous one:

```bash
python math_challenge_chain.py
```

#### Adventure Chain

This example creates an interactive adventure where each decision leads to a new part of the story:

```bash
python adventure_chain.py
```

#### Brand Creation Chain

This example combines storytelling, decision-making, and math to help characters create their brand:

```bash
python brand_creation_chain.py
```

### 5. Running the Tests

To ensure everything is working correctly, you can run the included tests:

```bash
pytest chain_test.py
```

## üéì What You'll Learn

By working through this project, you'll learn:
- How to implement Sequential Prompt Chaining to build complex workflows.
- How to manage context and back-reference outputs in a sequence of prompts.
- How to evaluate and compare results from multiple models using Fusion Chaining.

## üèÜ Conclusion

The **Minimal Prompt Chainables** project is a powerful yet simple tool for working with prompts in a sequential manner. Whether you're creating stories, solving math problems, or building a brand, this project shows how you can use chaining to manage complex tasks efficiently.

Feel free to explore the examples, modify the scripts, or even create your own chains. The goal is to understand how prompt chaining works and to have fun while doing it!
